title: Canada
description: Canada is a large, diverse country with vibrant cities and dramatic nature in easy reach. Vancouver offers oceanfront neighborhoods, mountain views, and walkable parks, while Toronto is Canada’s biggest city with arts, food, and neighborhoods from around the world. Trains and domestic flights make it simple to combine an urban stay with day trips or quick escapes to beaches, islands, or mountains. Four distinct seasons mean very different experiences—cherry blossoms and mild weather in spring, outdoor festivals in summer, colorful foliage in fall, and cozy winter scenes. As an English-speaking destination with welcoming, multicultural communities, it’s a comfortable place for a first longer trip, and visa options and tourism services are well established.

I’ve had many friends go to Canada for their studies, and this made me want to go—especially to Vancouver and Toronto. I applied for a Canada tourist visa and made a plan, but I haven’t done anything yet that guarantees my trip. I’m sure I’ll book a plane ticket soon, and I’m so excited about it. I even called my friend there to plan my visit and where to stay, which I’m really excited about.
