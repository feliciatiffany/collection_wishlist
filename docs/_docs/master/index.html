        <div class="floatItem" id="title"> Master Degree </div>
        <div class="floatItem" id="description"> A postgraduate degree that deepens expertise beyond the bachelor’s level and can improve career mobility, earnings potential, and professional credibility. Typical programs run 1–2 years full time (longer part time) and may be coursework-based, research-based, or a mix. Common formats include in-person, online, and hybrid; some offer cohort models, internships, capstones, or thesis options. Admissions usually consider undergraduate GPA, statement of purpose, résumé/portfolio, recommendations, and (program-dependent) tests such as the GRE or GMAT. Total cost varies by country and school and may be offset by scholarships, assistantships, employer sponsorships, or savings. Key decisions include field (e.g., MBA, data/CS, design/UX, public policy), program length, location/visa factors, accreditation, alumni network, and return on investment. Ideal timing is after gaining enough work experience to clarify goals and strengthen applications, but early-career pathways also exist. </div>

        <div class="floatItem" id="content"> <p>Education has always been really important to me. Even if it’s not in the near future, I believe I will pursue a master’s degree one day. Right now, I’m thinking I might take a MBA in business admistration or marketing ; however, I want to work a couple of years first to decide what I want to learn. I feel like experiencing the kind of work I will love will push me to take a master’s degree. This feeling might change but who knows.</p>
