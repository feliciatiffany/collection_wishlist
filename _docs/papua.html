        <div class="floatItem" id="title"> Volunteer in Papua </div>
        <div class="floatItem" id="description"> Volunteering in Papua typically involves community support in education, health outreach, environmental conservation, or basic infrastructure alongside local organizations or churches/NGOs. Projects often take place in remote areas, so planning for travel time, higher costs, and limited connectivity is important. Volunteers usually help with tutoring, workshops, simple refurbishment tasks, or logistics for community programs. Cultural sensitivity is essential, learn local customs, basic phrases, and follow guidance from community leaders. Expect simple accommodation, variable weather, and boat or small-plane transfers between towns. Good preparation includes vaccinations as advised by a doctor, travel insurance, clear roles and timelines, and a realistic budget for transport and supplies. Partnering with credible local groups and aligning skills to community needs helps ensure your contribution is respectful, safe, and useful. </div>

        <div class="floatItem" id="content"> <p>I love volunteering where I get to learn new things, meet inspiring individuals, and give back to society. It’s about fulfillment in life and experiencing things outside of my comfort zone. School teaches me knowledge, but volunteering teaches me about life and helps me see things from different perspectives. I think it’s a good way to push my boundaries and reflect on how my life is going now. Volunteering has always been a wonderful experience for me. Right now, I really want to try volunteering in Papua, a place in my country that has limited access. It’s very expensive and hard to get there because the area is still underdeveloped. They also have a culture very different from mine, and I know this will help me grow. Other than that, Papua has breathtaking natural views, which is another reason I want to see this wonder of the earth.</p>
